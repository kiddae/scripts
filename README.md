# my (useless) scripts
i might forget to commit and push everything so don't care about it that much plz
it has:
+ simple script manager (chscript, mkscript, rmscript)
+ wm-specific (raiseall, minimizeall)
+ rice-specific (setwall, randomwall, wallmanager, feh-blur => my fork!)
+ other useless things
